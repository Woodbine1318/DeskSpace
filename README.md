Our values are yours too:

# Our Values
Inspired
We do what we love and are connected to something greater than ourselves.

# Entrepreneurial
We are creators, leaders, and self-starters. We try new things, we challenge convention, and we’re not afraid to fail.

# Authentic
We are genuine to our brand, mission, and values. We're not perfect, and we don't pretend to be. We are always honest and as transparent as we can be.

# Tenacious
We never settle. We get great results, and we get them quickly. Be persistent and knock down walls—literally if you have to. You have our permission.

# Grateful
We are grateful for each other, our members, and to be part of this movement. We don't take success for granted. We’re happy to be alive.

# Together
We are in this together. This is a team effort. We always look out for one another. We have empathy, we know we're all human, and know we can’t do any of this alone.
